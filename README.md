# Fashion-Foresight
VGG16 Image Classification Model

## **Introduction**
For many individuals, selecting an outfit can consume a considerable amount of time. Fashion Foresight aims to assist users in comprehending their clothing collection to determine the categorization of their apparel. Numerous college students find it challenging to recognize their fashion style due to the ever-changing nature of the industry. This predicament often leads to succumbing to the temptation of fast fashion, which not only wastes money and time but also has a detrimental impact on the environment. Despite 62% of post-secondary students belonging to the Gen Z demographic considering sustainability while purchasing fashion items, this trend persists (Petro, 2020). The tool helps students to identify the fashion category that their wardrobe items fit into, simplifying the task of developing a fashion sense and introducing them to new styles. By comprehending their current fashion library, they can make well-informed buying decisions, minimize their contribution to fast fashion, and reduce the need for frequent wardrobe upgrades. To utilize Fashion Foresight, a user only needs to capture an image of their clothing item, and the tool's computer vision model will produce a style label that best matches the clothing piece. This method enables users to rapidly create an outfit that aligns with their desired appearance.
